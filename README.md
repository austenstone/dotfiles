# dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles.

## What are dotfiles?
[Dotfiles](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/personalizing-codespaces-for-your-account#dotfiles) are files and folders on Unix-like systems starting with `.` that control the configuration of applications and shells on your system. You can store and manage your dotfiles in a repository on GitHub. For advice and tutorials about what to include in your dotfiles repository, see [GitHub does dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/).
